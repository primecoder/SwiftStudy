# 2020.09.14 Started my study on Swift UI

Leaving my fulltime position at ME as Tech Lead, I needed to ramp up
my technical skills to get the next jobs. SwiftUI is one of the
important skills I must master.

I first started on witht the tutorial from Paul Hudson's series of
Swift UI tutorials.

Started the very [first chapter here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/swiftui-tutorial-building-a-complete-project)
